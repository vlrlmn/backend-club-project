            <p>Start your weekend in Muscat, the capital city, where you can explore some of Oman's most iconic sites. Don't miss the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque; it’s an architectural marvel and a great spot to learn about Omani culture.

This popular wadi, or valley, offers a hiking trail that leads to a hidden waterfall and crystal-clear pools you can swim in. It’s a refreshing break and truly a hidden oasis in the desert landscape. Just remember to pack a swimsuit, comfortable shoes, and maybe a picnic lunch to make a day of it.</p>
            <p>For those seeking a surreal experience, spend a night in the Wahiba Sands desert. There are a number of camps that offer a real Bedouin experience, complete with camel rides, dune bashing, and a night under the stars. The sunsets here are absolutely breathtaking, and the quiet of the desert at night is something you won't soon forget. It’s the perfect way to immerse yourself in Oman’s natural beauty.</p>
            <p>Round off your weekend with a trip to the coastal town of Sur, known for its traditional dhow-building yards.
